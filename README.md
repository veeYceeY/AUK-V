    AUK-V is a RISC-V 32 bit in in order processor with 5 stage pipeline  which supports RV32I base instruction set
    There is no branch prediction implemented (Will create another version with branch prediction)

## Requirements for running simulation

    ghdl
    gtkwave
## Create code rom in vhdl 
    cd tools
    make rom  
## Running simulation
    cd tools
    make sim
